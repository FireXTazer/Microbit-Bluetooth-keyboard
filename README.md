Hello all my first time using Github and here is a code i wrote it togggles through a-z and 1-10
and also some basic puntuation such as ""!?.,#;: if you have any problems ideas suggestions please let me know.

written in java and python                                                                         
only works with PCs with bluetooth                                                                 
makecode.microbit.org                                                                              
(supported v2 only)                                                                                

Keys                                                                                               
a: To go back                                                                                      
b: go forward                                                                                      
a+b: select                                                                                        

On start you will be greeeted with a loading screen meaning it can now be discovered as UBit[device name] when clicked the screeen will show a tick and load the code if not the script is not functioning correctly so re-install the code also check if your microbit is V2 since the code only works with V2. After it will say air OS as this is the code name after all this the code begins the logo isnt a button.                                                                    
Thank you.
